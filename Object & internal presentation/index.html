    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
        These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null,
        undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each
        (depending on their types).</p>
    <p>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as
        reference data-types. An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are
        given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where
        the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.</p>
    <p>Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive
        or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called
        properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>
    <p>For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like
        updateAddress, updateNam, etc.</p>

    <h4>Objects and properties</h4>

    <p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable
        that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables,
        except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You
        access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:</p>
    <p class="italic">objectName.propertyName</p>

    <p>Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case
        sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar
        and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:</p>
    <p class="italic">var myCar = new Object(); <br>
        myCar.make = 'Ford'; <br>
        myCar.model = 'Mustang'; <br>
        myCar.year = 1969;</p>

    <p>Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).</p>
    <p class="italic">myCar.color; // undefined</p>

    <p>Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation (for more details see
        property accessors). Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a
        string value that can be used to access it. So, for example, you could access the properties of the myCar object
        as follows:</p>
    <p class="italic">myCar['make'] = 'Ford'; <br>
        myCar['model'] = 'Mustang'; <br>
        myCar['year'] = 1969;</p>

    <h4>Creating Objects In JavaScript :</h4>
    <h4>Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal</h4>

    <p>One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside
        curly braces as shown below</p>
    <p class="italic">let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'}; </p>

    <h4>Create JavaScript Object with Constructor
    </h4>
    <p>Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create
        multiple objects of same flavor as shown below</p>
    <p class="italic">function Vehicle(name, maker) { <br>
        this.name = name; <br>
        this.maker = maker; <br>
        } <br>
        let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’); <br>
        let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)<br> 
        console.log(car1.name); //Output: Fiesta <br>
        console.log(car2.name); //Output: Santa Fe</p>

    <h4>Using the JavaScript Keyword new
    </h4>
    <p class="italic">The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:
        Example <br>
        var person = new Object(); <br>
        person.firstName = “John”; <br>
        person.lastName = “Doe”; <br>
        person.age = 50; <br>
        person.eyeColor = “blue”;</p>

    <h4>Using the Object.create method
    </h4>
    <p>Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows
        you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor
        function.</p>

    <p class="italic">// Animal properties and method encapsulation <br>
        var Animal = { <br>
        type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties <br>
        displayType: function() { // Method which will display type of Animal <br>
        console.log(this.type); <br>
        } <br>
        }; <br>
        // Create new animal type called animal1 <br>
        var animal1 = Object.create(Animal); <br>
        animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates <br>
        // Create new animal type called Fishes <br>
        var fish = Object.create(Animal); <br>
        fish.type = 'Fishes'; <br>
        fish.displayType(); <br>
        // Output:Fishes</p>
